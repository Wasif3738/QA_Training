# 🧪 QA Automation Training

This repository contains a complete set of practice tasks and final projects completed during my QA Automation Training at **A1QA**. The exercises cover essential concepts in Selenium WebDriver, BDD with Cucumber, TestNG, Allure Reporting, and advanced frameworks like Aquality — all implemented using **Java** and **Maven**.

Each folder represents a focused topic or project, structured with clean code and test design principles such as **Page Object Model**, configuration management, and environment-driven execution.

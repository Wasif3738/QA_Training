What is BDD(Behaviour driven development)?
BDD  methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behaviour a user expects to experience when interacting with it.
BDD is all about collaboration between teams. Specifically collaboration between the business team and the technical teams.
Builds a common understanding on the behavior of the application.
Generates common documentation that can be understood by all teams & stakeholders.

User Story:
A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user
For any new enhancement, feature, change user story is created.
1. It is discussed among teams.
2. Conversation & discussion on how the system should behave.
3. Examples are created, discussed, agreed and approved.
4. Examples are documented in a way that can be developed & tested with automation.
5. Coding phase - implement behaviour as per the documented examples.

3 practices of BDD:
1.Discovery-Agreed behaviour of the system: explore and & discuss on how the system should behave
2.Formulation-Documented Examples(Acceptance Tests): create concrete examples that can be automated
3.Automation-Code implementation & automation tests: Coding as per the documented examples to implement the agreed behaviour of the system. create automation tests taking one example at a time to guide development

Cucumber:
Cucumber is a tool that facilitates BDD
BDD practitioners may use cucumber to automate their documentation
Cucumber is a tool that understands your documentation and turns it into automated tests.

Gherkin:
Gherkin is a human-readable language for describing the behaviour of a system.
